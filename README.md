# Algorithm Practice in Python

## Overview
This repository is for practicing algorithms and data structures using Python. The project is organized into separate directories for basic algorithms, data structures, and advanced algorithms.

## Folder Structure
- **basic-algorithms/**: Foundational algorithms like sorting and searching.
- **data-structures/**: Implementations of data structures like stacks, queues, and linked lists.
- **advanced-algorithms/**: More advanced algorithms, including dynamic programming and graph algorithms.

## Running Tests
Install `pytest`:
```bash
pip install pytest
